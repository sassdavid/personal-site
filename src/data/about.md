# Intro

I am an employee of [Loxon](https://www.loxon.eu/) where I build tools to banks to make it easier to collect their unpaid portfolios accurately. If
you think I can be helpful to you or would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch.

# Currently

At Loxon, I have learned how to shape culture, develop relationships with customers, implement enterprise products, and build
microservice architecture with technologies
like [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/), [Angular](https://angular.io/), [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/),
and [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/). I primarily work as a Java developer but have broad experience across other stacks and languages.
