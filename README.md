## Acknowledgements

- Originally Forked from [Michael D'Angelo](https://github.com/mldangelo/personal-site) who did amazing work creating a simple, easily modifiable,
  statically-exportable React, Jamstack application built using modern javascript, based on create-react-app with React-Router, SCSS, github actions,
  and many other useful technologies.
- Template based on [Future Imperfect](https://html5up.net/future-imperfect) by [@ajlkn](https://github.com/ajlkn)
  for [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/).
- Dark Mode was implemented based on the implementation of [Paige Johnson](https://github.com/Paigej/portfolio-site) by
  using [Donavon's](https://github.com/donavon) custom [React Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html) which
  has [fabulous documentation](https://github.com/donavon/use-dark-mode).
